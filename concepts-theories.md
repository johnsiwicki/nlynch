# User Delight

"UI embellishments can only produce surface delight; deep delight can only be achieved in functional, reliable, and usable interfaces."

- Hierarchy of User Needs
    - Superior needs (such as pleasure and delight — at the very top of the pyramid) can only be achieved after more fundamental needs (such as functionality, reliability and usability) are fulfilled.
- Surface & Deep Delight
    - Surface Delight: Isolated interface features such as: animations, clever microcopy, hi-res imagery
    - Deep Delight: The interface works as expected (or better), and meets user needs at the right time and place.

- *Real world Example:* Cake and frosting
- *Web examples:* Yelp.com & Unroll.me See source link

### Conclusions
- Focus on the overall experience first - Functionality, reliability, usability
- UX flare should be secondary and enchance or compliment the experience
- No one ever said, “I’m thrilled this beautiful product doesn’t work as well as I expected.”
- If, by pursuing delight, the end goal of a functional, reliable, and usable product gets lost, rethink the solution.

# Occam's Razor

"A principle stating that among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. *To put it in the design context, Occam’s Razor states that the simplest solution is usually best.*"

Also this:

"Simpler concepts are preferable over more complex ones because they are more testable."

Works in conjunction with Hick's Law

- *Real world example:* Who built the pyramids? Humans or Aliens?
- *Web example:* Is the company open for business? Woods Basement Systems https://www.woodsbasementsystems.com/ vs. simple contact number with option to call the customer back if office is closed.

### Conclusions
- Don't overcomplicate or clutter with words, logos, images. 
- Keep it simple & straightforward.

# 80/20 Rule

"20% of the functionality and features in any one environment will be responsible for 80% of the results, or actions taken within that environment."
  
 - Real world example: Bowl of jelly beans. Most of the time (80%) people will eat the red ones, which make up about 20% of the bowl.
 - Web example: "Contact Us" buttons/links make up roughly 20% of homepage actionable elements, yet result in 80% of the user interactions.
 
### Conclusions 
- Set up analytics to help identify the 20%.
- Simplify your designs and layouts based on the elements that fall under the 20% most-used functions.
- Remove noncritical functionality or content that’s not used often.
- Don’t spend too much time optimizing stuff that falls in the 80% that’s not often used.

# Hick's Law

"The time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of options increase."
"Choice paralysis"

- Real world example: The old menu board at Seymour Sandwich. Dozens of pieces of paper hung above the counter with daily specials, sandwich options, salads, etc.
- Web example: Amazon.com

### Conclusions
- Examine the number of options displayed on the site and determine how this will affect the users’ overall approach to decision making.
- Categorizing Choice: Help narrow down huge volumes of information without overloading the user.
- Obscuring complexity: By reducing the number of options on screen, it’s more likely that the user will reach the end of the process rather than abandon the site.
- K.I.S.S.: Keep It Simple and Straightforward.
