# 80/20 Rule

"20% of the functionality and features in any one environment will be responsible for 80% of the results, or actions taken within that environment."
  
 - Real world example: Bowl of jelly beans. Most of the time (80%) people will eat the red ones, which make up about 20% of the bowl.
 - Web example: "Contact Us" buttons/links make up roughly 20% of homepage actionable elements, yet result in 80% of the user interactions.
 
### Conclusions 
- Simplify your designs and layouts based on the elements that fall under the 20% most-used functions.
- Remove noncritical functionality or content that’s not used often
- Don’t spend too much time optimizing stuff that falls in the 80% that’s not often used
