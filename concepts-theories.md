# 80/20 Rule

"20% of the functionality and features in any one environment will be responsible for 80% of the results, or actions taken within that environment."
  
 - Real world example: Bowl of jelly beans. Most of the time (80%) people will eat the red ones, which make up about 20% of the bowl.
 - Web example: "Contact Us" buttons/links make up roughly 20% of homepage actionable elements, yet result in 80% of the user interactions.
 
### Conclusions 
- Set up analytics to help identify the 20%.
- Simplify your designs and layouts based on the elements that fall under the 20% most-used functions.
- Remove noncritical functionality or content that’s not used often.
- Don’t spend too much time optimizing stuff that falls in the 80% that’s not often used.

# Hick's Law

"The time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of options increase."
"Choice paralysis"

- Real world example: The old menu board at Seymour Sandwich. Dozens of pieces of paper hung above the counter with daily specials, sandwich options, salads, etc.
- Web example: 

### Conclusions
- Examine the number of options displayed on the site and determine how this will affect the users’ overall approach to decision making.
- Categorizing Choice: Help narrow down huge volumes of information without overloading the user.
- Obscuring complexity: By reducing the number of options on screen, it’s more likely that the user will reach the end of the process rather than abandon the site.
- K.I.S.S.: Keep It Simple and Straightforward.
